            <h2>VISION, MISSION & PRINCIPLES</h2>

            <p>We are committed to connecting people to reshape the future. And the following principle underpin our work at

                Institute.</p>

                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Learning</strong><br>
                                We truly believe that learning actually free people’s creative energy, and their potential;
                                it makes them active agents of the betterment of their social conditions.

                            <li><strong>Quality</strong><br>
                                We always connect excellence to our image with the desire to achieve the best
                                possible qualities in every accomplishment.
                            </li><br>
    
                            <li><strong>Empowerment</strong><br>
                                We strongly have faith in equal access to opportunities as an effective
                                avenue for socially vulnerable people to rise up social ladders if given a chance.

                            <li><strong>Truth and Reliability</strong><br>
                                Our sole pursuit is Truth for we believe like William O. Douglas that
                                “truth is the proper and sufficient antagonist to error” and that truth
                                is the only way for man and human communities towards emancipation
                                and happiness. In this pursuit of Truth, we elect not only to consider
                                reliability as our basic working principle but also to always be on the side
                                of reliable knowledge.
                            </li><br>
    
                            <li><strong>Transformative and ethical Leadership</strong><br>
                                We trust in transformative and ethical leadership to drive the best out of each
                                person towards creating a better world.
                            </li><br>
    
                            <li><strong>Freedom of thought and expression</strong><br>
                                We strongly believe that man needs full freedom of thought and expression to realize
                                his utmost capacities and become a cultured citizen of the national and world communities.

                            <li><strong>Human dignity</strong><br>
                                Our whole work is driven by the urge to uplift human dignity, to understand man and the
                                universe,
                                and to explore how best both can sustainably serve humanity.

                            <li><strong>Gender Equality</strong><br>
                                Our conviction is that empowering women is tantamount to doubling the speed in improving the
                                human
                                condition
                                and creating a fairer and more prosperous and peaceful world.

                            <li><strong>Interconnectedness</strong><br>
                                Despite recent moves back to nationalism, we think that the basic achievement of
                                globalization
                                which is a connected world in which problems facing humanity pull together thinkers and
                                contributors
                                across borders and cultures without any discrimination should not be rolled back.
