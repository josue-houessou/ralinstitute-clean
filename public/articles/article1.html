                The Leeds Beckett University graduation ceremony is a prestigious event that celebrates undergraduate,
                postgraduate and
                research students. The university ranks 960th out of 20,966 in the world, 91st in the UK, and 624th in
                Europe.

                Tunji specifically graduated from the Northern Film School which is part of Leeds School of Arts. The
                Northern Film
                School at Leeds Beckett University is considered one of the top film schools in the UK. The Hollywood
                Reporter named it
                one of the top five film schools in the world to watch. It took Tunji 7 years to complete his research
                including making
                a documentary film with one year lost to the COVID-19 pandemic. He was warmly congratulated and thanked by many
                African guests
                for keeping Africa and Nigeria on the map.

                Identifying the Cinematographic Visual Representation of Nigerian Cinema: our Investigation into the 
                Visual Identity of Nigerain Cinema or Nollywood and how it represents itself through the camera lens.

            <h3 class="hook2">Abstract:</h3>
            <p>
                This research investigates the identity of cinematography in Nigerian Cinema or Nollywood from 1992 onwards.
                The thesis
                investigates how Nigerian Cinema visually represents itself through the camera lens and examines its style
                of
                cinematography to establish whether Nigerian Cinema has a particularly unique visual identity – a ‘look’ and
                ‘style’. It
                then explores these questions: If it does, does this pose a barrier to global audiences? If so, how can
                filmmakers
                create a visual look that transcends the African diaspora to reach a mainstream audience, and maintain a
                distinct
                Nigerian cultural identity?
            </p>
    
            <p>
                It is within this framework that part of this investigation involves the creation of a documentary focusing
                on a range
                of interviews with five directors of photography, who discuss Nollywood and Nigerian Cinema’s
                cinematography. A range of
                articles, books and journals using qualitative research methods are critiqued and their findings considered
                as part of
                this investigation. Based on this review of the existing literature in this area, it is evident that the
                cinematography
                and visual aesthetic of Nigerian Cinema are yet to be investigated in any depth. Thus, this thesis offers
                not only a new
                area of study but also one that looks back at the origins of Nigerian Cinema and its links to Yoruba Theatre
                and
                Nigerian schools of art, from the colonial period to the present, to help create an exciting new area of
                knowledge and
                study.
