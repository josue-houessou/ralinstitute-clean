                        Latifou is currently taking our level B1 course of the English Proficiency Summer Training (EPST) 2025 after
                        successfully completing the level A2 course. He has seen tremendous improvements in his English skills since
                        joining our classes. In this short text, he tells us how the teaching method has helped him make quick 
                        progress.

                    Our main English instructor teaches with passion and a clear sense of purpose. He always smiles when he enters the
                    classroom, and his smile creates a warm and pleasant atmosphere that immediately puts us at ease. His way of teaching is
                    simple yet effective, because he explains every lesson with practical examples that we can easily understand and
                    remember. He uses stories, real-life situations, and interactive exercises that keep our attention alive. <br> <br>
    
                    His pedagogy is unique because it combines discipline with kindness. He listens carefully to our questions, encourages
                    us when we hesitate, and corrects our mistakes with patience. He never judges us, but instead he motivates us to try
                    again. His qualities as a teacher—his humility, his simplicity, his clarity, and his dedication—make him a true model
                    for us. The entire class feels happy and motivated to learn whenever he is present. His energy fills the classroom with
                    life, and we all participate with enthusiasm. The lessons are never boring because he makes them dynamic and
                    interactive. We enjoy working in groups, practicing dialogues, and answering his questions. <br> <br>
                    He always finds a way to make every student feel important. Because of him, we develop confidence in speaking and
                    writing. The atmosphere in the class is joyful, friendly, and supportive, and this makes learning English not only a
                    school subject but also a pleasant experience. We laugh together, we share ideas, and we grow as learners. Every student
                    feels that English becomes easier and more interesting thanks to his teaching style. Personally, I feel deeply motivated
                    by the way he teaches. He always pushes me to give the best of myself. His humility and simplicity inspire me to work
                    harder and to believe in my abilities. He helps me improve my pronunciation by showing me how to produce sounds
                    correctly. <br> <br>
    
                    He teaches me how to identify stressed and unstressed syllables, and how to recognize the different vowel sounds in each
                    syllable. He explains grammar rules in a clear and memorable way, and he gives me exercises that strengthen my skills.
                    Little by little, he makes me speak English with more confidence, and he guides me to sound more like a native speaker.
                    Thanks to him, I discover not only the rules of English but also the joy of expressing myself in this beautiful
                    language.
