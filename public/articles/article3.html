                    Often touted as the 2nd largest film industry in terms of the volume of films its produces, it is more
                    prolific than
                    Hollywood, producing over 1000 films compared to the USA’s 504 in 2023 but it still remains behind
                    Bollywood. </p> <br> 
                <p class="text-left">
                    Nollywood’s films and TV series populate the main global streaming services like Netflix and Amazon, and
                    its own
                    indigenous online network called Ibaka TV. Nollywood contributes over $1billion dollars to Nigeria’s
                    GDP, and it employs
                    directly and indirectly approximately 1 million people. <br> <br>
    
                    Nollywood arose from the economic austerity of the 1980s when Nigerian filmmakers and actors
                    collaborated to make their
                    own films when money from the government dried up. They soon realised that they could sell these films.
                    At first on
                    video tapes and then on video compact discs. It was in 1992 that the first hit film Living in Bondage
                    directed by Chris
                    Obi Rapu materialised, generating a decent profit. It was not too long before other filmmakers and their
                    backers
                    (marketeers) realised this earning potential and soon the production of films was widespread. <br> <br>
    
                    Nollywood is the generic nickname given to Nigerian Cinema, however smaller film industries which are
                    tribal in origin
                    have emerged in other parts of the country. To the North of Nigeria which is predominantly Muslim
                    (Fulani and Hausa) is
                    Kannywood, based in the city of Kano. In the East the industry is located in Asaba (Igbos). The Yorubas
                    dominate the
                    South of the country with the main centre being in Lagos.
                    What makes Nollywood so special is that films and stories focus on African issues and culture, and
                    therefore enabling
                    Nigerian and African audiences around the world to watch content they can likely relate to such as
                    marriage, women’s
                    issues, getting rich and even Vodoun/Juju. <br> <br>
    
                    Some of the major figures in Nollywood are women such as Mo Abudu who established EbonyLife and has
                    turned it into one
                    of the largest production companies in Africa. Its films and TV content populate Netflix. Actress and
                    Director Funke
                    Akindele has one of the longest running TV sitcoms, Jenifa’s Diary which began in 2008 and has amassed
                    over 30 seasons.
                    Her film, A Tribe Called Judah, is to date the highest grossing film Nigerian Movie. Bolanle
                    Austen-Peter is a lawyer
                    turned theatre director/film director who in 2024 directed the film titled Funmilayo Ransome Kuti,
                    mother of Fela. Her
                    work has won multiple awards.
                    and is testament of Nollywood’s continuous rise to one of the world’s leading film industries.
